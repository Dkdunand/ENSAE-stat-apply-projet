# ENSAE-stat-apply-projet
The project builds a pipeline to quantify and explain predictive uncertainty. Using conformal prediction, it provides calibrated confidence intervals, identifies factors driving uncertainty through explainability methods, and links these insights to better, risk-aware decision-making across domains like finance and healthcare.
